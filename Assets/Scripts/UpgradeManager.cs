    //Set up all upgrade references - Dictionary?


    //loop to check gold vs how much you need per upgrade?
    //if you don't have enough button should be greyed out and if you try to click on it nothing will happen or maybe the button or currency will flash red
    //Upgrades you can buy will be colored, like green or something to show you can afford it
    //Have to update currency so when you buy upgrades it removes that currency from your total


    //Connect upgrades to player / gameplay so they affect him or spawn allies in scene (added health and damage from allies or ability you can use?)


    //Add the clear option when starting a new game / wipes all upgrades.

    //Upgrades - Set value each upgrade (+10) or just a multiplier (*2) - Probably multiplier (fix enemies to match if I do this one)
                                                                            //also try to not have multiplier be to crazy, like health increasing by 100 or more
    //Balance is hard, both enemy and player need to scale similarly so game feels smooth and not a mess ((sudden increase in stats)should be more gradual)
    //Game takes 30 mins or so ? Don't want to take to long or be to fast. May have to tweak number of waves depending on balance and multipliers

    //Damage 1
    //Damage 2
    //Health
